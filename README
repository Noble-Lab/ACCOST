ACCOST assigns statistical significance to differences in contact
counts in Hi-C experiments. ACCOST uses a negative binomial to model
the contact counts, and pools contacts at the same genomic distance to
aid in estimating the mean and variance of the data.

For details on how to run the software, see manual.html.
